# Scripta-Veritas
Scripta Veritas is a Python-based tool that transforms digital text—typed, scanned, or image-based—into realistic, handwritten-style pages. It applies visual effects like jitter, pressure variation, and smudging while allowing users to select fonts, ink colors, and input methods such as manual text, files, or OCR from images.
